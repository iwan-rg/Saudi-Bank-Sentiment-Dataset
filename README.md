# Saudi Bank Sentiment Analysis Dataset
The Saudi banks' corpus data were collected from Twitter using Tweepy python library. We used the banks' Twitter account mentions of the four Saudi banks to retrieve the tweets.The data were collected for a whole month, starting from the 1st of September 2021 until the 30th of September 2021, throughout the COVID-19 outbreak when all bank institutions switched their services online. During that period, most people encountered online issues when using their bank services. Therefore, due to the COVID-19 constraints, social media platform such as Twitter was the main channel to communicate with the bank's organizations. 
This dataset contains customersâ€™ sentiments on Twitter toward four Saudi Banks (AlRajhi bank, Alinma bank, Saudi National Bank (SNB), and Saudi Investment Bank (SAIB)) . A total of 12k tweets 8,669 of them is labeled as "Negative", 2,143 is labeled as "Positive", and 1,236 tweets is labeled as "Neutral".
